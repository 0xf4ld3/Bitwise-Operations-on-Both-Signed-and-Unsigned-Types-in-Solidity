# Bitwise-Operations-on-Both-Signed-and-Unsigned-Types-in-Solidity
Let's see how Bitwise Operators works in Solidity

**In the above solidity file [bitwiseOperators.sol](https://github.com/0xf4ld3/Bitwise-Operations-on-Both-Signed-and-Unsigned-Types-in-Solidity/blob/main/bitwiseOperations.sol) I have demonstrated ways in which different bitwise operators can be operated on signed and unsigned types in _SOLIDITY._**

## Basically, these bitwise operators include:
  * Bitwise AND &
  * Bitwise OR  |
  * Bitwise Exclusive OR ^
  * Bitwise SHIFT operators
    * LEFT SHIFT  <<
    * RIGHT SHIFT  >>

# ****NOTE:****
   ###    In all my examples I have used the 8-bits field size meaning there are limitations of inputs 
   ###    ie. For unsigned types inputs range from _-128 to 127_
   ###        For signed types inputs range from _0 to 255_
